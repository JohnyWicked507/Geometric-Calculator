**Geometric Calculator in Java**

This is a project for a geometric calculator implemented in Java. It allows you to calculate the area and perimeter of
different geometric figures such as circles, squares, triangles, rectangles, and pentagons.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the program with the following command:

```shell
javac ./Main.java ./src/Circle.java ./src/Square.java ./src/Triangle.java ./src/Rectangle.java ./src/Pentagon.java
```

5. Run the program with the following command:

```shell
java -cp src Main
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to select the geometric figure and the operation you want to perform (area or
perimeter), and then enter the necessary data when prompted.
